\subsection{Weighted Residual Methods}

Consider the following general problem:
\[
	\partial_t u(x,t) -  \mathcal{L} u (x,t) =  \mathcal{N}(u)(x,t),  \hspace{8pt} t>0, x \in  \Omega
\]

Where $ \mathcal{L} $ is a leading spatial derivative operator, and $ \mathcal{N} $ is a lower-order linear or non-linear operator involving only spatial derivatives. Here, $ \Omega $ denotes a bounded domain of $ \mathbb{R}^d $, $ d=1,2, \text{ or } 3 $. This equation is to be supplemented with an initial condition and suitable boundary conditions. \\
\indent We shall only consider the WRM for the spatial discretization, and assume that the time derivative is discretized with a suitable time-stepping scheme. Among various time-stepping methods, semi-implicit schemes or linearly-implicit schemes, in which the principal linear operators are treated \textit{implicitly} to reduce the associated stability constraint, while the non-linear equations are treated explicitly to avoid the expensive process of solving nonlinear equations at each time step, are most frequently used int eh context of spectral methods. \\
\indent Let $ \tau $ be the step size, and $ u^k(\cdot) $ be an approximation of $ u(\cdot ,k \tau) $. As an example, we consider the Crank-Nicolson leap-frog scheme for the equation:
\[
	\frac{u^{ n+1 } - u^{ n-1 }}{2 \tau} - \mathcal{L}\left( \frac{u^{ n+1 } + u^{ n-1 }}{2}  \right) =  \mathcal{N}\left( u^{ n } \right) \hspace{4pt} n \geq 1
\]

We can rewrite this as
\[
	\mathbf{L}u(x) := \alpha u(x) - \mathcal{L}u(x) = f(x), \hspace{4pt} x \in \Omega
\]

where $ u = \frac{u^{ n+1 } + u^{ n+1 }}{2} , \alpha = \tau^{-1} $ and $ f = \alpha^{ n-1 } + \mathcal{N}\left( u^{ n } \right) $.
