\pubdescrip{%
This book grew out of lectures on Riemann surfaces given by Otto Forster at the universities of Munich, Regensburg, and MÃ¼nster. It provides a concise modern introduction to this rewarding subject, as well as presenting methods used in the study of complex manifolds in the special case of complex dimension one.
