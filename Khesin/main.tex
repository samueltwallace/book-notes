\maketitle

\begin{pubdescrip}
	\indent This monograph gives an overview of various classes of infinite-dimensional Lie groups and their applications in Hamiltonian mechanics, fluid dynamics, integrable systems, gauge theory, and complex geometry. The text includes many exercises and open questions.
\end{pubdescrip}

\begin{transcribernote}
	\indent These notes were taken as part of a personal project for understanding some aspects of symplectic geometry better. Though the project was not completed, this book helped me bridge the connection between functional analysis and infinite-dimensional Lie groups. \\
	\indent The reader should probably read \textit{Foundations of Mechanics} before reading this if they have no previous experience with symplectic geometry or dynamics on manifolds. There is some overlap between the two, so you can compare and contrast the two books' approaches.
