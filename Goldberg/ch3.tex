\section{Curvature and Homology of Riemannian Manifolds}
\subsection{Some Contributions of S. Bochner}

\begin{prop}

If $ \Tilde{M}$ is a covering manifold of $M$ which is also compact, then
\[
	b_p(M) \leq b_p( \Tilde{M})
\]


\end{prop}

\subsection{Curvature and Betti Numbers}

\begin{lem}
For a regular 1-form $ \alpha$ on a compact and orientable Riemannian manifold $M$
\[
\int_M \delta \alpha * 1 = \int_M \delta \alpha \wedge * 1 = 0
\]

\end{lem}

\begin{defn}
Define the operator $Q$ by 
\[
	(Q \alpha)_i = R^j_i \alpha_j
\]
where $ R^j_i$ is the Ricci curvature tensor.
\end{defn}

\begin{thm}
	The first betti number of a compact and orientable Riemannian manifold of positive definite Ricci curvature is zero.
\end{thm}

\begin{defn}
	A \textit{parallel vector field} is one for which 
	\[
		A(t) = \alpha^i (t) \frac{ \partial }{\partial u^i } 
	\]
	is parallel along any parametrized curve $u(t)$.	
\end{defn}

\begin{thm}
	In a compact and orientable Riemannian manifold a harmonic vector field for which the quadratic form $ \langle Q \alpha, \alpha \rangle$ is positive semi-definite is necessarily a parallel vector field.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
In a coordinate neighborhood of a compact and orientable Riemannian manifold with the local coordinates $u^1, \ldots, u^n$, $ \alpha$ is a harmonic one form if and only if
\[
R^j_i \alpha_j = g^{ ik }D_k D_j \alpha_i = 0
\]

\end{thm}
