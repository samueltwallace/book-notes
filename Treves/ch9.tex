\section{Finite Dimensional Hausdorff Topological Vector spaces. Linear Subspaces with Finite Codimension. Hyperplanes}

\begin{thm}
	Let $ E $ be a finite-dimensional Hausdorff TVS. 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $ E $ is isomorphic, as a TVS, to $ \mathbb{C}^{ d } $ where  $ d = \dim E $ .
		\item Every linear functional on $ E $ is continuous.
		\item Every linear map of $ E $ into any TVS $ F $ is continuous.
	\end{enumerate}
	
\end{thm}

\begin{cor}
	Every finite-dimensional Hausdorff TVS is complete.
\end{cor}

\begin{cor}
	Every finite dimensional linear subspace of a Hausdorff TVS is closed.
\end{cor}

A space is said to be \textit{locally compact} if it has a basis of compact neighborhoods.

\begin{thm}
	A locally compact TVS is finite dimensional.
\end{thm}

\begin{defn}
	A linear subspace of codimension one is called a hyperplane.
\end{defn}

\begin{prop}
	A hyperplane $ H $ is a vector space $ E $ is a maximal proper linear subspace or $ E $ .
\end{prop}

\begin{prop}
	A hyperplane $ H $ in a TVS $ E $ is either everywhere dense or closed.
\end{prop}

\begin{prop}
	Let $ E	 $ be a TVS and $ M $ a closed linear subspace of $ E $ of finite codimension. Then there is a homomorphism $ p $  of $ E $ onto $ M $ such that $ p^{ 2 } = p $ . Also, $ E = M \oplus \ker p $ . The homomorphism is called a projection. It is both continuous and open.
\end{prop}
